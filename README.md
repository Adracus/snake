# snake

This is my snake implementation written in Rust using rust-ncurses for
rendering.

If you want to build and/or run this project, you need to have
`cargo` properly configured and installed on your system.

To quickly run the project, just `cd` into the directory of this
repository and issue `cargo run`.

In order to build a binary, enter `cargo build`.
If you want to have all production optimizations, issue
`cargo build --release` instead.
